el_geometry.py -- ideal el-template geometry for Zephyr.

Pure geometry of the L-shaped ("el") templates used to build clique embeddings on a Zephyr graph.
Every value computed here depends only on the Zephyr grid size m and the ideal Zephyr topology;
nothing depends on the tile size of Zephyr, t, or which nodes or edges a particular Zephyr graph
actually has.

Coordinates
-----------
Coordinates are Zephyr Cartesian (x, y, k), following the convention of
:class:`dwave.graphs.ZephyrCartesianCoord`, with x, y integer lattice coordinates with different
parity in [0, 4m] and k in range(t). Orientation is fixed by the parity of x: even x is a vertical
qubit (y is then odd), odd x is a horizontal qubit (y is then even).

    node / qubit   (x, y, k)   a Zephyr node in Cartesian coordinates, k in range(t)
    block          (x, y)      a quotient Zephyr node (k folded out)

The functions here are entirely QUOTIENT (k-agnostic): they take and return block coordinates (x, y)
only, with k folded out, so nothing here depends on the tile size t. A "quo" in a name -- the
QuoSpan type, the v_quo/h_quo values -- marks exactly that: the object stands for every k at once.

El-templates
------------
A pair of a vertical block and a horizontal block (v_block, h_block) generically induce a unique
L-shaped path between the blocks. That path is the shortest path you would take from v_block to
h_block: travel along v_block's quotient external path toward h_block, hop one internal coupler
across to the nearest-to-h_block block on h_block's quotient external path, then continue along that
path to h_block. The induced el-template is this L-shaped path -- two arms meeting at the elbow,
one from each block. Pairs whose elbow falls outside [0, 4m] induce no el-template.

A QuoSpan is a 4-tuple giving an interval [a, b] on a single quotient external path, together with
the fixed coordinate of the path and its shift -- the varying coordinate's residue mod 4 (1 or 3) --
selecting which of the two interleaved quotient external paths with that fixed coordinate is meant.
The vertical and horizontal spans do NOT share a tuple layout -- the fixed coordinate and the shift
occupy opposite slots:

    vertical   QuoSpan corresponding to a vertical block (v_x, v_y):
        (v_x,       v_y % 4,  v_a, v_b)   ->  y-span [v_a, v_b] on column v_x
    horizontal QuoSpan corresponding to a horizontal block (h_x, h_y):
        (h_x % 4,  h_y,       h_a, h_b)   ->  x-span [h_a, h_b] on row    h_y

so a vertical span is (fixed x, shift, ...) and a horizontal span is (shift, fixed y, ...); callers
unpack the two positionally and must respect the difference. A template also has a length -- the
number of blocks along both arms, equivalently the qubit count of an instantiated chain.
