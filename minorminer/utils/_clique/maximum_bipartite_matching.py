def maximum_bipartite_matching(X: Iterable[Hashable],
                               Y: Iterable[Hashable],
                               edges: Mapping[Hashable, Iterable[Hashable]],
                               ) -> Mapping[Hashable, Hashable]:
    """Find one maximum matching in a bipartite graph (Hopcroft-Karp).

    Args:
        X: Iterable of left vertices. Any hashable values work (e.g. ints or
            strings), since vertices are used as dict keys.
        Y: Iterable of right vertices (same hashability requirement as ``X``).
        edges: Mapping from each ``x`` in ``X`` to an iterable of its
            ``Y``-neighbors. Vertices with no edges may be omitted.
            ``edges`` must map vertices in ``X`` to vertices in ``Y``; passing
            keys or neighbors outside these sets is undefined.

    Returns:
        A dict mapping each matched ``x`` to its matched ``y``. Unmatched
        vertices are absent, so ``len(result)`` is the size of the maximum
        matching. If several maximum matchings exist, one of them is
        returned; which one depends on iteration order.

    Notes:
        Uses the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm (O(sqrt(|V|) . |E|)), where 
        |V| = |X| + |Y| is the number of vertices and |E| is the total
        number of edges. See
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopcroft%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm>

        The augmenting-path search (``dfs``) is recursive, with recursion depth
        bounded by the length of the longest augmenting path in a phase, i.e.
        O(|X| + |Y|) in the worst case. Python's default recursion limit is of
        order of 1000, so inputs where |X| + |Y| is within a few hundred are
        safe.

        This is the same algorithm as `networkx.bipartite.hopcroft_karp_matching`
        in <https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.bipartite.matching.hopcroft_karp_matching.html>
        (except for the greedy warm-start and the BFS shortest-path prune). The
        main advantage of this implementation is for usage in cases where this
        function is called in a hot loop where the inputs are already in the exact
        form this function needs: the two vertex sets are known by construction and
        the edges are already a plain adjacency dict. Using
        `networkx.bipartite.hopcroft_karp_matching` instead would require
        constructing a `nx.Graph` (node/edge insertion, attribute dicts) on every
        call and passing the bipartition we already know as `top_nodes`. In addition,
        `networkx.bipartite.hopcroft_karp_matching` returns a symmetric mapping; when
        a one-directional {left node: right node} map is wanted, that result must be
        stripped. This custom version returns the one-directional map directly.
